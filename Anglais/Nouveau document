Where in the World is...

-> Cool things : 
	- crowdsourcing
	- easy access to tutorial (can't escape before you start)
	- good pictures
	- 3 steps "clear"
	- "mosaÃ¯c" -> nice

-> Bad things : 
	- not so clear to understand how to use it
	- design depending on the Smithsonian
	- individual pages : information not clearly accessible

- importance of a clear design : to make the website attractive AND intuitive.
	If it doesn't look attractive, then it makes the user suspicious about the project itself
	On the other hand, it is necessary not to emphasize too much the attractiveness of the 		website at the cost of its functional aspect.
